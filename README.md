Entry for SpaceJam 2021 (Team Coderly Rock)
Our project is an image recoginition system, which extracts text from images and converts them into audio files and editable text.
The audio files help the blind and illiterate understand the text given in the images
We have used: pyTesseract.
Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for python. That is, it will recognize and “read” the text embedded in images.
Python-tesseract is a wrapper for Google’s Tesseract-OCR Engine. It is also useful as a stand-alone invocation script to tesseract, as it can read all image types supported by the Pillow and Leptonica imaging libraries, including jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, and others. Additionally, if used as a script, Python-tesseract will print the recognized text instead of writing it to a file.
We have used flask to make the basic webpage which we will be hosting. FLask combines html, javascript and css to make a webpage
We have used multiple libraries like Werkzeug, Keras, langdetect to help with the recognition of the text
